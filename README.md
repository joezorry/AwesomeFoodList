# Awesome Food List project

## Introduction

This is a very basic app that utilizes a Lifesum API to check for differents foods.

Right now it only lists the protein included in the food search result, however, this is quite pointless if we were not 
looking at the amount of kcal/grams to compare it too, never the less, it's just a basic implementation atm.

This app is built with Orma-Android and Dagger2.

## Instructions

You need an API key from Lifesum. You paste that API key into the ```auth_token.properties``` file.

When that is done, the app should be search-able and you can save your favorites into the internal database 
for offline viewing.
